		My dad is amazing. It's funny, but I didn't know that until I<br/>
		found out he was going to die.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was going to happen<br/>
		soon.&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was real.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought about a lot of stuff.<br/>
		Things I hadn't thought about for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I kind<br/>
		of took him for granted or something.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, our parents are<br/>
		just always there.&nbsp;&nbsp;You expect them to always be bugging you<br/>
		to clean up your room or study harder or have good manners or<br/>
		try new things to grow up to be a more well-rounded person one<br/>
		day.&nbsp;&nbsp;And make you get up early on the weekend to have<br/>
		"family time" and all that other stuff that used to drive me<br/>
		crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't feel that way now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything's different since<br/>
		Dad got his diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I realized that one day in the<br/>
		near future, he might not be around to drive me crazy.</p>

            Now I feel lucky when he asks me about my day (I used to totally hate that<br/>
            question) or nags me about coming home on time at night and being respon-<br/>
            sible. One day he won't be here to ask.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I feel lucky when I hear<br/>
            his car pulling into the driveway after school. I even like to hear him cough-<br/>
            ing. It means he's still around. Still my dad.</p>

            My dad is the chemistry teacher at my high school and he's annoyingly smart.<br/>
            I mean, super brainiac annoying.&nbsp;&nbsp;He knows the most random stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;Like<br/>
            how at room temperature, mercury is the only metal that is in liquid form.<br/>
            And water expands as it drops in temperature, and by the time it's frozen it<br/>
            takes up about 9% more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;Or that if you slowly pour a handful of salt<br/>
            into a totally full glass of water, it won't overflow. In fact, the water level<br/>
            will go down.&nbsp;&nbsp;He's always dropping the little facts about everything. He<br/>
            doesn't realize what a geek he is for doing it, he's just really into chemistry.<br/>
            I think he really doesn't understand that not everybody is.&nbsp;&nbsp;He likes to cook<br/>
            because of chemistry - he mostly makes breakfast - because he says chemi-<br/>
            cal reactions happen all the time in cooking and he's always explaining as he<br/>
            goes. I don't take his class at school but I hear he's a pretty good teacher.<br/>
            He gets a lot of practice at home, that's for sure.</p>

                The whole time I've been in high school (I'm a sophomore) I've always had to<br/>
                hear what other kids thought of him. I was always Mr White's kid.<br/>
                (Sometimes they call him Mr. Wallabee which is the name of the totally loser<br/>
                shoes he always wears).&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kids dissed him just to get on my nerves.<br/>
                Some kids just dissed him period because that's what you do with teachers.<br/>
                The thing is though, he expects everyone to do their best just like he does,<br/>
                and when you don't try your hardest he doesn't cut you any slack. That's<br/>
                how he is at home and at school.&nbsp;&nbsp;I only just figured out what a good qual-<br/>
                ity	that is. That's what makes him brave in his cancer battle and what<br/>
                made me brave, too when I was younger.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I wanted to be or not.<br/>
                Anyway, I always just wanted to be some regular kid in school but because of<br/>
                my dad being a teacher there I was different.&nbsp;&nbsp;I realize two things now.<br/>
                First, I am already different because I have C.P. so that's a done deal.<br/>
                And two, he's the right dad for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't do a lot of physical stuff be-<br/>
                cause of my disability and that's okay with my dad and it wouldn't be with a<br/>
                lot of other dads I've met.&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd be disappointed because they're into<br/>
                sports or whatever.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, my dad doesn't have a disability but you sure<br/>
                wouldn't want to see him throw a football. So in that way, we get along. It<br/>
                makes sense that he's my dad and I'm his son. My point is, I don't care<br/>
                about what the kids at school say anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bottom line is he's a good<br/>
                teacher and no one can say he doesn't care about what he does. I know he<br/>
                cares.&nbsp;&nbsp;After our family, chemistry and teaching kids is what he loves the <br/>
                best.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to make sure he gets to keep doing what he loves to do<br/>
                for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;For him, for his students, and for me and my family.</p>

                 One thing I don't understand is why saving someone's life costs more than a<br/>
                regular person can pay. And why some doctor's (usually the best ones) don't<br/>
                take insurance.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that's wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, one of the big reasons why<br/>
                my dad didn't want to get treatment at all in the first place was because he<br/>
                didn't want to leave us behind with a huge debt. That's the thing about my<br/>
                dad - he loves us more than anything. More than himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;But we want him<br/>
                around and we want him to try everything he can to stay with us as long as<br/>
                possible. This surgery is the one chance there is to save his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we<br/>
                can't afford it. And every day that goes by is one less day I'll have with<br/>
                him. And I don't want to tell my little sister about my dad.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want her to<br/>
                know him for herself.</p>

            <p class="textoamarelo">What a wonderful dad I have,<br/>But he is in trouble.</p>
            <p class="textoamarelo">It's Lung Cancer.<br/>He needs an operation. Now!</p>
